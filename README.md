# Milestone project 2
# General Knowledge Online Quiz

[]() is a website designed to entertain and quiz people of all ages on thier general knowledge.  

This website was targetted at people who want to test their general knowledge on a range of topics, want to gain more information on general topics and want to entertain themselves with a fun quiz. The timer section will have a countdown of 30 seconds, to put some urgency on the users answering the questions. There will also be a score section so that users are able to see how well they've done. This will give them the incentive to keep playing again in hopes of beating their high scores. 

This website was built using knowledge gained from HTML, CSS and JacaScript modules, for the purpose of completing my second Milestone Project for the Code Institute's full stack developer course. This website is easy to navigate and easy to read, with a clear goal and aim.
